    <h2>Why this blog?!</h2>
    <div><p>Some people are super effective. They speak at meetups and conferences, write posts, books, make tutorials, learn things, have a life, do sports. I mean, that’s a lot of stuff! How do they do that? Are they sleeping? Or is it about being motivated and well organized?</p>
<p>Some of my friends and I meet once a month to work together, we are all working in different remote companies. During a coffee break, we were talking about those super-productive people. It was at that moment someone popped up with the Learn in Public method.</p>
<p>Ok … but what the hell is it? In a few words <em>Learn in Public</em> is having the habit to produce public resources about what you have learned. It could be a post, a video, a speech and so on … your choice! In some articles is mentioned one more rule; the audience should be <strong>your future self</strong>, and in my opinion, this is the most important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t judge your results by “claps” or retweets or stars or upvotes - just talk to yourself from 3 months ago. - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/">swyx.io/learn-in-public</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I created this blog. I want to try this method to help me improve my organization skills and my effectiveness. A public blog for my future self could be the right motivation.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it is going to work for me, but there is only one way to know; try it and see how it goes!</p></div>
